From the hidden
depths of the earth
where ancient
magical currents
intertwine, the
crystals are born.

Each one is a
vessel of a pure
magic, shaped by
the forces
it embodies, with
colors and
structures as
unique as the magic
they carry.

These crystals
are treasured
by alchemists
and craftsmen alike,
for them rests
untapped power,
waiting to be
unleashed in
the enchanted
artifacts and
powerful tools.
